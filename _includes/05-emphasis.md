My first encounter with programming language is taken by **C++**. I learn to *evaluate* the number resulted from the code.
Then I faced **pascal**. I was got so many programming practices, especially in beginner algorithmic fields. I *shape* my procedural computational thinking.

Then **haskell** came in the way. *Adapting* functional programming paradigm is interesting in many algorithmic problems to be solved.
Nothing much learned after that, until I got some short courses in **introductory web development**. I *learned* how to turn on the server with xampp and using bootstrap to divide page in column.

I explored **php** to build local file viewer, and *following* some w3schools article.
I *solve* some **hackerrank problem** because I think it's worth trying.
I did some programming in **arduino** by building a just-connected NodeMCU project.
I *do* some **data logging** things with my teams using grafana.

I *found* interesting **python** philosophy.
I *paste* **introductory** data science related python code into jupyter notebooks.
I *fine-tuned* summarization huggingface transformers **AI model** using Google Collab with my team.
I *use* **octave** to do some array manipulation problems in signal processing.

I *installed* some **linux** distros: ubuntu, manjaro, opensuse, and oracle linux to discover new things.
I *build* some applications to be installed for fun and profit of new jxperience with **npm, cargo, cmake**.
I *search and try* some regex in linux text processing utilities like **sed**.
I *develop* my management system project in **java** to gain initial sense of making frequently used apps.
