3. I feel like flying in utilizing CLI apps, especially since I met fish shell :rocket:
   - Shell completion in fish
     * Choose by tab
     * Autocomplete by shadow text, and just press End in keyboard.
     * Command completion
     * Some parameter and argument completion
     * File path completion
   - Different syntax and result in xonsh, pwsh, nushell, and elvish
     * ls in nushell provide beautiful table view

     * xonsh can be used directly for calculator and reading python package help
     * elvish have so many things to go, like map
   - String operation with sed, awk, and other similar tools 
     * Can be found freely in StackOverflow or Unix Stack Exchange with google
     * Playing with regex
